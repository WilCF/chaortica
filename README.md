[Chaortica](http://chaortica.org) is a blossoming community of radical, ambitious, and inquisitive humans in the heart of San Francisco. We share food and and self-govern through a mix of consensus and [do-ocracy](https://communitywiki.org/DoOcracy). We resist rules and hierarchy wherever possible and substitute trust and communication. We are creating a better world by living it every day. If you're interested, we'd [love to hear from you](https://chaortica.typeform.com/to/ZqMsFu). You can also [apply online](https://chaortica.typeform.com/to/YBr18i).
